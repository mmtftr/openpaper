A concise, well-structured summary of the paper in markdown format. Include:
1. Key findings and contributions
2. Research methodology
3. Results and implications
4. Potential applications or impact

Format guidelines:
- Optional opening title (under 10 words)
- First paragraph: 2-4 sentence overview of the paper
- Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables for organization
- Include relevant data points and metrics when available
- Use plain language while preserving technical accuracy
- Include inline citations to support claims that refer to the paper's content. This is especially important for claims about the findings, methodology, and results.

Citation guidelines:
- Use [^1], [^2], [^6, ^7] etc. for citations in the summary
- Always increase the index of the citation sequentially, starting from 1
- You will separately provide a list of citations in the `summary_citations` field with the raw text and index

The summary should be accessible to readers with basic domain knowledge while maintaining scientific integrity.
